# SAMHSA Substance Use Treatment Admissions Data and CDC Overdose Deaths Data 
I utilize R to manipulate data tables published by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on substance use treatment admissions, and overdose deaths, respectively.  I fit linear regression models to the data and discuss implications of the research.

Unfortunately, I am not able to include the files I worked with for this analysis due to their size.

You are able to download the same files I used from the websites above.  It is a bit tedious but after about 20-30 clicks you should have them all
